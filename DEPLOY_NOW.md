# IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT FIX

## The Problem
Replit runs Drizzle migrations BEFORE your build command executes, so the production database never gets the TEXTâ†’INTEGER fix.

## The Solution (2 steps)

### Step 1: Temporarily match production's current state
Change schema.ts to use TEXT (matching production), deploy successfully.

### Step 2: After successful deployment
Fix production database manually, then update schema back to INTEGER.

## I'm implementing this now...
