# 🎯 AURA ACTION PLAN - DATABASE RESET + PHASE 2 ROADMAP

**Created:** October 21, 2025
**Status:** Ready for Execution
**Goal:** Get to production TODAY, then scale to ultimate AI assistant

---

## 🚨 PART 1: IMMEDIATE - FRESH DATABASE SETUP (2-3 hours)

### **Objective:** Unblock deployment by starting with clean database

### **Task List:**

#### ✅ Task 1.1: Backup Current State (5 min)
**Why:** Safety net in case we need data
**Action:**
```bash
# On Replit, export any important data
# (Probably none since this is pre-production)
# If you have test data you want to keep, export via database pane
```

#### ✅ Task 1.2: Drop All Tables (2 min)
**Why:** Remove schema with wrong types
**Action on Replit:**

**Option A - Database Pane (Easiest):**
1. Click **Database** in left sidebar
2. Look for **"Reset Database"** or **"Drop All Tables"** button
3. Click and confirm

**Option B - SQL Console:**
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS audit_logs CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS pending_confirmations CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS appointments CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS assistant_settings CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS whatsapp_messages CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS sessions CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users CASCADE;
```

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
-- Should return empty or only system tables
```

#### ✅ Task 1.3: Create Fresh Schema (5 min)
**Why:** Rebuild with correct INTEGER types
**Action on Replit:**
```bash
npm run db:push
```

**Expected Output:**
```
✓ Creating table: users
✓ Creating table: sessions
✓ Creating table: whatsapp_messages
✓ Creating table: appointments (duration: INTEGER ✓)
✓ Creating table: assistant_settings (duration: INTEGER ✓)
✓ Creating table: pending_confirmations
✓ Creating table: audit_logs
✓ All tables created successfully
```

#### ✅ Task 1.4: Set Environment Variables (10 min)
**Why:** Security configuration
**Action on Replit Secrets:**

```bash
# Generate webhook secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
# Copy output
```

Add to **Replit Secrets:**
```
# CRITICAL - Must set these:
TELEGRAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=<paste-64-char-hex-from-above>
AUTHORIZED_TELEGRAM_CHAT_IDS=<your-telegram-chat-id>

# Verify these exist:
DATABASE_URL=<should-already-be-set>
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<should-already-be-set>
AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY=<should-already-be-set>
AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_BASE_URL=<should-already-be-set>
SESSION_SECRET=<should-already-be-set>

# Optional:
LOG_LEVEL=info
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=https://your-app.repl.co
```

#### ✅ Task 1.5: Build & Deploy (15 min)
**Why:** Get to production
**Action on Replit:**
```bash
# Type check (expect 3 pre-existing errors - OK to ignore)
npm run check

# Build for production
npm run build

# Deploy via Replit UI
# Click "Deploy" button
```

#### ✅ Task 1.6: Verify Deployment (10 min)
**Why:** Confirm everything works
**Actions:**

1. **Health Check:**
```bash
curl https://your-app.repl.co/health
# Expected: {"status":"healthy","checks":{...}}
```

2. **Test Telegram Bot:**
   - Send `/start` to bot
   - Should get welcome message
   - Send "What's my schedule today?"
   - Should get AI response

3. **Test Unauthorized Access:**
   - Send message from different Telegram account
   - Should get "⛔ Unauthorized" message

4. **Check Database:**
```sql
-- Verify correct types
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'appointments' AND column_name = 'appointment_duration';
-- Should show: integer

SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'assistant_settings' AND column_name = 'default_meeting_duration';
-- Should show: integer
```

### **Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All tables created with INTEGER duration fields
- ✅ Health endpoint returns 200 OK
- ✅ Telegram bot responds to authorized user
- ✅ Unauthorized users blocked
- ✅ No TypeScript errors (except 3 pre-existing - ignore those)

### **Time to Production:** 2-3 hours max
